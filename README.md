My design work 001

###Step 1: Determine informations I want to deliver
I am building a page to introduce books I like. The books are about designing.

###Step 2: Content inventory
First, I would like to write down all items to be show off on the page.  

- Title
- Books info (title, cover image, author's name, comments including commentator)
- Quote about designing
- My name & My avatar (John Wu & avatar: webmaster@leapoahead.com)

Because it is hard to collect the authors' facebook/twitter/email address, so we will just use placeholder for those information. The detailed content describtions will be in [content.md](content.md).

###Step 3: Wireframes
I created wireframes with [OmniGraffle](www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/), which is a great tool to work with. The wireframe image can be found [here](wireframe/wireframe.jpg).

###Step 4: Make content structured
The next step I did is to organize informations I just collected in the Step 2. I used [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) to convert the [structured_content.md](structured_content/structured_content.md) into a [working html copy](structured_content/structured_content.html)

###Step 5: Wireframes for breakpoints
For now, I will just create one breakpoint, 768px. For all viewport width < 768px, the [mobile wireframe](wireframe/mobile-wireframe.jpg) will be adapted. Otherwise, the [original wireframe](wireframe/wireframe.jpg) designed for all viewport width >= 768px will be adapted.

###Step 6: Design for various breakpoints
Then, it is time to create a more concreate design for various breakpoints (only two of them to do here, though).  
So don't forget to sketch. I choose to use pencil and paper, instead of using tools like AI.
