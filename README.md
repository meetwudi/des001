My design work 001

###Step 1: Determine informations I want to deliver
I am building a page to introduce books I like. The books are about designing.

###Step 2: Content inventory
First, I would like to write down all items to be show off on the page.  

- Title
- Books info (title, cover image, author's name, author's facebook/twitter/email address, comments including commentator)
- Quote about designing
- Share the page to social media
- My name & My avatar (John Wu & avatar: webmaster@leapoahead.com)

Because it is hard to collect the authors' facebook/twitter/email address, so we will just use placeholder for those information. The detailed content describtions will be in [content.md](content.md).
